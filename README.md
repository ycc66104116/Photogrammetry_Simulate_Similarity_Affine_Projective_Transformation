# Photogrammetry_Simulate_Similarity_Affine_Projective_Transformation
## You can conduct image similarity, affine and projective transform through the program here.
* Download the whole file in this repository.
* Execute the file "WpfApp1.sln" in the folder "WpfApp1".
* You can use the clear window to finish the function mentioned above, help you generate the calculated coefficient and processed images which conducted with bilinear interpolation in both forward and backward transformation.
